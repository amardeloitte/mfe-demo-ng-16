<h1>Introduction to Angular concepts</h1>
<p>
  Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client
  applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It
  implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries
  that you import into your applications. The architecture of an Angular
  application relies on certain fundamental concepts. The basic building blocks
  of the Angular framework are Angular components that are organized into
  NgModules. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular
  application is defined by a set of NgModules. An application always has at
  least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more
  feature modules.

<ul>
  <li>
    Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can
    choose among and modify according to your program logic and data
  </li>
  <li>
    Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly
    related to views. Service providers can be injected into components as
    dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Modules, components and services are classes that use decorators. These
  decorators mark their type and provide metadata that tells Angular how to use
  them.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that
    defines a view. A template combines ordinary HTML with Angular directives
    and binding markup that allow Angular to modify the HTML before rendering it
    for display.
  </li>
  <li>
    The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to
    make it available to components through dependency injection (DI)
  </li>
</ul>
